# Deep Dream
My own implementation of the Google Deep Dream code, with added Java Swing GUI

Requirements:
* Java 1.7
* Python 2.7 with scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, PIL, IPython)
* Caffe deep learning framework with its own natural requirements 
* Protobuf library
* A GPU with CUDA support would be great but not necessary

To do:
* Make py code actually save different formats not just jpg images with png extensions
* Teach the GUI to identify a failure in the Python code
* Add about app to help text
